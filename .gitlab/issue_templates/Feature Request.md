# Why

Explain in a few sentences why the feature is necessary and what kind of problem
is it actually trying to solve. This gives more context to the problem and avoids
a situation where the implementation can miss the actual problem that needed solving.

For bigger features it's also good to add context from conversations that happened
offline or in other services.

# Feature Details

Explain in a few sentences what you want the feature to do.


# Technical Details

When it comes to more complicated features like a whole API endpoint,
try to write down in simple steps of what needs to be implemented and how
you envision the end result.

This could include:
* Formatting of the API's response.
* Any status codes you want the endpoint to give.
* Validations you want to happen.
* Future plans and extensions with the feature.
* How the feature ties together with other components.
